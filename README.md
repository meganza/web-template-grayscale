Hello! This is just some random practice for me.

I'll be using photoms from https://www.pexels.com.
Button hover will come from https://freebiesupply.com/blog/css-button-hover-effects/. I don't exactly know which one exactly but I'll update this when everything gets specific already.

Thanks for checking it out!
